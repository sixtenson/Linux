Especially for Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA

1. ALCFIX: A script to fix the flickering audio on ASUS Zenbook 3 UX390UA

2. WIFIFIX: I ran into a problem when installing Xubuntu on my Zenbook 3, i fixed it with this simple command

3. .gtkrc-2.o : My personal gtkrc file, nothing special, sets clock and action widget color to #FFFFFF (white)
